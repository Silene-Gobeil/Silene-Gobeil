### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I created this Github repository to follow the course "Data Sciences fundamentals" of the university of Bern.

The course material was provided by [Sigve Haug](https://github.com/sigvehaug/DSF-DCBP).

In this course I learned how to :
- create a Github repository 
- work with Numpy
- work with Pandas
